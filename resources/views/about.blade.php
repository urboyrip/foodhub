                            In the era of increasingly advanced technological developments like today, people need a system that makes work easier. This includes the process of ordering food, and the existence of defects in transactions where the seller does not receive payment from the buyer and the length of the queue at the time of ordering. The reason for using the FIFO method in making this application is because in addition to many advantages such as the actual and relevant value of inventory costs, this system is expected to produce an application that helps in ordering, includes easy and transparent menu selection, and reduces queues when ordering.
